👋 Hi there! I'm **Angel (LUBO616)** 🐺⚡  
🚀 **Automation Engineer** | 🛡️ **Cybersecurity Enthusiast** | 🧠 **CTF Player**

I build systems that **save time, reduce human error, and scale reliably** — from quick automations to full workflow pipelines.  
My focus is to connect tools like LEGO blocks 🧩: take what’s needed, assemble fast, deploy clean, and iterate.

### 🧰 What I do
- 🤖 **Automation & Orchestration:** designing end-to-end workflows with **n8n**, webhooks, schedulers, and integrations
- 🐳 **Container-first mindset:** **Docker**, reusable stacks, reproducible environments, clean deployments
- 🧑‍💻 **Linux & Scripting:** bash + CLI tooling, server setup, troubleshooting, monitoring, and ops hygiene
- 🔌 **APIs & Integrations:** REST/JSON, auth flows, data parsing, custom connectors, system-to-system communication

### 🛡️ Security side quest (serious one)
- 🔐 **Hardening & Best Practices:** securing Linux services, least privilege, secrets hygiene, and safe automation patterns
- 🕵️ **OSINT & Recon:** mapping attack surfaces and understanding real-world exposure
- 🧪 **Pentesting fundamentals:** learning by doing, documenting, and improving defenses

### 🧩 CTF / Learning Mode
- 🚩 Active in **Hack The Box / TryHackMe** — sharpening skills in:
  - 🐧 Linux privilege escalation
  - 🌐 Web vulnerabilities (OWASP style)
  - 🔑 Auth, sessions, and misconfigurations
  - 🧠 Problem solving under pressure

### 🎯 Current goals
- 📦 Build a “container LEGO” repo: reusable services/stacks you can plug into any project
- 🤝 Create automations that are **secure by design** (not just “it works”)
- 📈 Keep leveling up through labs, writeups, and hands-on practice

✨ If you’re into **automation, security, DevOps, or CTFs**, let’s connect!
